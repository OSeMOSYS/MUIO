MUIO: Modelling User Interface for OSeMOSYS
================================

OSeMOSYS stands for "Open Source Energy Modelling System." It is a linear programming model designed for long-term integrated assessment and energy planning. It is particularly useful for informing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Long-Term Strategies (LTS), and Decarbonization Plans.

MUIO is a user interface that facilitates data management, model creation, and scenario analysis using OSeMOSYS.

OSeMOSYS has been applied at various scales, from continental energy systems (such as African Power Pools, South America, and EU28+2) to national, regional, and even village-level models.

Designed to be cost-free, with a fast learning curve and minimal time commitment, it is accessible to a wide range of users, including developers, modellers, academics, and policymakers. Thanks to its transparency, it is widely used for training and dissemination.

ðŸ“– Explore our latest literature `review <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0973082624002552>`_ on OSeMOSYS applications, enhancements, and future research directions.

ðŸŽ“ Join our Open University `course <https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=13558>`_ to learn how to build an energy system model from scratch using OSeMOSYS and MUIO.

This project is maintained by Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).
