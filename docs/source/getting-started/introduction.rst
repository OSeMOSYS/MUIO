MUIO is the latest user interface designed for creating OSeMOSYS models, building upon previous interfaces such as MoMani and ClicSand. This all-in-one application enables users to manage input data, customize scenarios, run models, and visualize results—without requiring additional software installations, as it includes all necessary dependencies.

Purpose
=============
OSeMOSYS is an optimization model used to assess the medium- and long-term evolution of integrated systems, including energy, land, water, and materials. Its modular structure allows for the representation of diverse value chains. For instance, it can model the production chain of synthetic hydrocarbons, incorporating Fischer-Tropsch or methanation processes.
Over the years, OSeMOSYS has evolved in both applicability and adoption across various stakeholders. Some key applications demonstrating its flexibility include:

* `Power sector capacity expansion planning <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X20301267>`_
* `Transport sector planning <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361920918310861>`_
* `Regional energy integration analysis <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667095X23000168>`_
* `Sector coupling assessment <https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/15/3805>`_
* `Climate, energy, land, and water systems modeling <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X22001237>`_
* `Economic analysis in energy planning <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032123005658>`_

Key Outcomes
=============

OSeMOSYS provides valuable insights, including:

* Primary energy production per year and per source
* Energy consumption by sector, technology, and year
* Energy production by sector, technology, and year
* Capacity expansion pathways by technology and year
* Investment, operating, and additional costs (e.g., carbon taxes) per sector, technology, and year
* Greenhouse gas emissions trajectories per fuel, sector, technology, and year

Why Use It?
=============

OSeMOSYS offers several advantages over similar models:

* Fast learning curve – The straightforward mathematical formulation and comprehensive training materials facilitate quick adoption.
* Open-source and adaptable – Users can adapt the tool to suit their needs.
* No upfront costs – The software is freely available to anyone, anywhere.
* Large community of practice – Multiple channels exist for collaboration, troubleshooting, and knowledge sharing.
