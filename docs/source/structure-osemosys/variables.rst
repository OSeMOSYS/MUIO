Variables

The variables represent the outputs generated by the model. Like the parameters, they are also functions of elements belonging to one or more sets. The following subsections provide a list and brief description of all the variables computed by the OSeMOSYS code. In MUIO, only a selection of these variables (marked with an asterisk) is available for visualization. However, the complete set of variables can be downloaded and plotted externally, based on the modeller’s requirements.
