Structure of OSeMOSYS in MUIO
###########################

As previously discussed, MUIO serves as an interface for creating and operating OSeMOSYS models. Behind the scenes, 
the mathematical model includes the sets, parameters, variables, and equations used in the optimization process. 
These elements are commonly referred around linear programming models (further explanation can be found `here <https://web.mit.edu/lpsolve/doc/LPBasics.htm>`_). 
The following sections describe the structure of this mathematical model, with examples provided to illustrate the use of each component.
