Examples and Use Cases
-------------------

Have you built a useful energy model using MUIO? We'd love to include it as an example to help others learn and build faster. Here's how to contribute an example to the documentation:

‚úÖ What Makes a Good Example?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We welcome examples that:

* Use MUIO in real or hypothetical case studies (e.g. countries, regions, sectors).

* Demonstrate specific features (e.g. multi-regional modelling, transport sector, emissions).

* Include complete data files, clear naming, and a brief description.

* Are small enough to run quickly (or include a simplified version).

üöÄ How to Contribute an Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Prepare your files

   - Organize your example in a folder under ``examples/`` (e.g. ``examples/CountryName/``).
   - Include:
     
     - Model input file (.zip)
     - A ``README.md`` describing the model purpose, data source, and assumptions
     - *(Optional)* Output plots or summary results

2. Fork and clone the MUIO repository.

3. Add your folder under ``/examples``.  
   If it‚Äôs large, consider linking to an external repository or storage (e.g. Zenodo, Figshare).

4. Add a reference in the documentation

   - Edit the examples section in the documentation (``docs/source/examples.rst``).
   - Add a short entry linking to your example folder or external repo.

5. Create a pull request  
   Submit your changes with a short description of your example.

üìù Licensing and Attribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Please include a note in your README.md indicating data sources and your preferred citation (if any).

* Make sure you have the right to share the data and code you include.
