This repository contains the user interface for the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). OSeMOSYS is a linear optimization energy system model designed to minimize total system costs while ensuring energy demands are met within specified constraints. It facilitates optimal allocation of energy resources, technologies, and investments over time, supporting long-term energy planning and policy analysis.

In order for MUIO to solve problem created with UI you will need to download GLPK and COIN CBC solver.
In development environment in folder WebAPP\SOLVERs create two folders named COIN-OR and GLPK.
In COIN-OR folder unpack exactly this version of CBC binaries Cbc-2.7.5-win64-intel11.1.
In GLPK folder unpack version glpk-4.65.
Folder tree for CBC should look like WebAPP\SOLVERs\COIN-OR\Cbc-2.7.5-win64-intel11.1\bin

1.	Download the latest version of the user interface from [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=wE8mz7iun0SQVILORFQISwwn5YyR7ONHs-3JdG3f5AFUODlJOEQwWTBXMlRRNFUwNEpUTUZYQ1RXOS4u). 
2.	Move the .exe file from your download folder to a folder where you have administrator privileges. This may be for instance inside the folder: users>>name_of_the_user or any other folder you prefer. 
3.	Right-click on MUIO.exe and click ‘Run as administrator’. This will start the installation of the MUIO. The installation may take several minutes. Once it is complete, the installation window will simply disappear. 
4.	The App will open automatically once the installation is complete. If not, search on the Windows Taskbar for ‘’MUIO’’ and open the App. 
5.	You will see the MUIO in a new window.
